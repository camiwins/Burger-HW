# Burger-HW

In this assignment, we created an app that displays burgers that you can make and eat. You'll create the burgers and devour them to move them from one side to the other.

>Note from Cami: This was the hardest assignment by far. I've spent nearly 10+ hours on it and had to scrap my original code to start over. However, I'm glad I did because I learned more the second time and feel confident about it.

# Instructions
In order to use this app safely, you must not be hungry. Consider this a warning.

1. Type in the name of the burger you want to eat
2. The burger should appear on the left side of the page
3. Click Delete if you made a mistake
4. Click Devour if you want to eat it and move it to the right side of the page

>Note from Cami: I found out that I wasted SO time trying to code the buttons to switch the burger back to the 'un-eaten' side. Womp womp. Oh well.
